<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction Project</h1>
<p>
    The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to use machine learning to predict 
    whether a passenger survived or not based on various features. Using the Titanic 
    dataset, the project involves exploring and cleaning the data, performing feature 
    engineering, and selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm. The model is 
    then trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned for optimal performance. I was able to 
    achieve around 89% accuracy.
